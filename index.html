Just outside the city, I visited Batu Caves, a Hindu temple set in limestone caves, where I got to interact with wild monkeys! I spent a day at Genting Highlands, aka the Las Vegas of Asia. It is a hill station city located on the peak of Mount Ulu Kali at 1,800 meters elevation. It is also where the world's largest hotel is located.</p> </td>
